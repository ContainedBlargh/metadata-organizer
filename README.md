# metadata-organizer
A small project written entirely by ChatGPT, how about that.

## The app itself

It consists of two scripts, one script recursively constructs a database of file meta-data based on a path to a directory.

The other script is a flask server that presents whatever is stored in the database.

## Conversation

So, ChatGPT turns out to be a remarkably productive partner. I deliberately decided to be completely hands off, almost all of the code is simply copy-pasted.

In the conversation.md file, you can follow my conversation with ChatGPT as I ordered it around until it had created this website. I felt like a real slave-driver!
